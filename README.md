# Ben's 2d Game Engine

This is my little pet project to build a game engine/future game. It's a 2d game engine written with Golang and mainly using the ebiten engine.

At this point, it is still very much under development and in experimentation, but over the years I hope this gains more and more functionality.

# Install and run locally

> Install Go if you don't have it yet - find it on its official website.

**To run:**

This script runs the `cmd/test_run/test_run.go` command

```shell
bash run_game.sh
```

This command is intended for testing out features of the game as they are developed.
