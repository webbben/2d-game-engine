# My game set in ancient rome
Below I want to start brainstorming and writing down ideas for details and features of my game I'm dreaming up. Hopefully, someday I'll actually start
making it.

## Overview
Here are some high level details
* Game is 2d, pixel art
* an open world game, where you can go where you like, as you please
* the player will be guided to follow some sort of "main story", but perhaps there will be lots of different optional paths.
* there will be lots of factions they can join beyond just the "main story" (if we decide to truly have a "main story")
* we will start with just one city probably, but ideally this can grow into a multi-regional thing (Italy, greece, gaul, etc?)
* there will be items to discover, potions, weapons, armor, and more
* if the player dies, they *may* be dead forever (game over scenario). But through-out the game, they may have the chance to get
"extra lives" - things like an enchanted revival charm from a god, or some other idea perhaps.
  * this will encourage the players to play more carefully, and not do wreckless things as much, which I like.
  * but, at the same time, it gives them the ability to strive for these "extra life charms", for added safety.
  * an extra life charm will be single use, of course.
* there may be "dynamic" characters in the game, that move around the game on their own accord and seek their own goals.
  * this would make the game a lot more exciting to play, and make the world feel a lot more alive.
  * most of the dynamic NPC behavior will just be slightly random though. but hopefully we can make them do things that would align with their goals.
  * it would be cool if they would be traveling around the map at random periods of time

## User gameplay
Here are some details of what I envision the user gameplay will be like.

### different beginnings
When you make a character, you will choose a few things that will determine how the game starts.
* difficulty
  * if you choose easy difficulty, you may start as a lesser noble/elite, like the son of a senator or something like that.
    * starting here would give you immediate access to some wealth, and some basic fame such that people wont treat you too poorly from the beginning
  * if you choose normal, you may start as the son of a merchant
    * starting here would mean you may have access to some basic amount of money, but very little. you would have the neutral level of fame, meaning you are not famous or known, and people treat you as an ordinary citizen. some people may treat you poorly, others will treat you as ordinary.
  * if you choose hard, you may start as a young man who is an escaped slave from a nearby province.
    * you have no wealth, and you have zero fame and people's disposition towards you is very low (they can tell you are of the slave class).
    * it will be difficult to find people who are willing to deal with you fairly, and it will be hard to get past that initial barrier of bad reputation.

In the future, as the game expands to having multiple regions, starting characters may be able to choose their starting race/culture as well. For now,
this is out of scope though.

### earning money, gaining fame and reputation
This game will have gold as its basic currency, which enables you to buy things or gain services.

You can earn money in lots of ways, such as:
* doing odd jobs and tasks, side quests
  * there will be NPCs that offer random tasks, such as delivering something to a noble in town, or getting them certain items, like fish, ore, etc.
  * there will be side quests you can discover, that may also pay you in gold or valuable items
* selling things
  * there will be plenty of shops that buy different types of goods, like weapons and armor, food products, ore, rare items, etc.
* joining a faction
  * these factions will have quests and jobs that can earn you money

More advanced options later in the game:
* opening your own shop, farm, or other property-based enterprise
  * this will earn you passive income without much interaction from you being required.
  * however, these may have liabilities, such as:
    * needing security - unsecured shops, farms, etc might be robbed or raided.
    * having better security makes this less likely to happen
    * if you have no security, this could end up costing you more than you earn, for example
    * as your fame rises and you gain enemies, they might target your assets
